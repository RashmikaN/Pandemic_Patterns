# Pandemic Patterns - Navigating the Impact on Illinois' Small Businesses
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the multifaceted impact of COVID-19 on small businesses within the state of Illinois. By carefully gathering, analyzing, and visualizing data, we uncover vital insights revealing the challenges small businesses in Illinois faced during the pandemic. Our goal is to suggest strategies to help them become more resilient in the post-pandemic era.
## Data Sources
The primary data sources for this project are:
- U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)
- Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Development

Data Preparation
The data preparation process involved the following steps:
- Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and addressing outliers from the collected datasets.
Feature Engineering: Incorporating additional relevant features such as the number of employees, industry, and geographical location.
- Exploratory Data Analysis
The project includes an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, where various visualizations were created to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the data. A few aspects that are covered in these visualizations are:

  - Impact of COVID-19 on small business revenue
  - Distribution of jobs reported by business age
  - Loan distribution heat map across Illinois counties
  - Correlation between loan and forgiveness amounts
  - Analysis of loan amount and loan status patterns
  - Urban vs. rural distribution analysis
  - Average loan amounts across loan statuses with error bars
  - Heatmap of average loan amounts by top counties and business age
  - Trend analysis of loan approvals with rolling statistics
  - Distribution of jobs reported by borrowers
  - Loan purpose analysis by business type

## Machine Learning Analysis
The project incorporates several machine learning models to predict and analyze different aspects of the pandemic's impact on small businesses in Illinois:
- Gradient Boosting Regressor: Predicts survey estimate percentages to gauge the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on small businesses based on their survey responses.
- Random Forest Classifier: Predicts the impact level (less impacted, moderately impacted, highly impacted) on small businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Logistic Regression: Predicts the likelihood of a PPP loan being forgiven based on loan characteristics and borrower details.
- K-Means Clustering: Segments small businesses based on their survey responses, identifying different behaviors or impacts due to COVID-19.
